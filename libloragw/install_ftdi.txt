# Description:
#	Installation procedure for FTDI SPI-over-USB dependencies

# [STEP 1] Install libftdi
sudo apt-get install libftdi-dev

# this should install :
# - libftdi-dev 0.19-4 (armhf)
# - libftdil 0.19-4 (armhf)
# - libusb-dev 2:0.1.12-20 (armhf)

# [STEP 2] Download and unpack the libMPSSE 1.3
# File must match SHA1 Checksum: 1b994a23b118f83144261e3e786c43df74a81cd5
wget http://libmpsse.googlecode.com/files/libmpsse-1.3.tar.gz
sha1sum libmpsse-1.3.tar.gz
tar -xzvf libmpsse-1.3.tar.gz

# Go to the src directory and install the library
./configure --disable-python
make
sudo make install
# Static and dynamic libraries compiled code is put into /usr/local/lib
# Header file is put into /usr/local/include

# On the Pcduino, you must regenerate the library cache (might some time).
sudo ldconfig

# [STEP 3] to allow non-root applications to access the FTDI device on USB
# copy the provided 99-libftdi.rules file in /etc/udev/rules.d
# For the nano board, only the FT2232H line is required.
# Non-root users members of plugdev group will be able to access the device.

# [STEP 4] Unpack the LoRa Gateway project and go to its directory.
# Configure build options in library.cfg, then build the library and examples.
make all

# [STEP 5] Connect a nanoconcentrator and run test_loragw_reg to test that
# you have access to LoRa registers.
# Less than 50 registers of the ~300 registers should return a mismatch.

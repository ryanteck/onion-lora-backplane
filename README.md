Backplane PCB &amp; Software for LoRa Gateways using Onion Omega

#What is this repo for?
I'm designing an Lora Gatway Backplane that will use the Onion Omega 2 + as it's brain. However due to the small amount of flash memory on an Onion Omega, all of the software has to be cross compiled.

This reposestory aims to host the pre-compiled versions of the software for Onion Omega 2+.

#Software Contained:
*Patched GLIBC
*lora_gateway
*packet_forwarder

#PCB Contained:
The finished PCB will also be stored in this repo and is licensed under OSHW.

#Licenses:
The software has it's own licenses found in their folders. The PCB Is released under OSHW, however will be availble to buy from me as the PCB and possibly a kit.

If you get it made yourself elsewhere then donations would be appreciated.
